Known bugs
----------

* TextMate seems not to load the plugin if you drag a folder to its icon and
  it's not already running. You'll then get the "old" drawer layout.
* The same applies to opening existing TextMate project (``*.tmproj``)
  while TextMate is not running.

Release notes
-------------

2009-01-27
##########

the Reveal in Project menu item is working again, thanks to fixes from the
community
I've decided to remove the fake blue-ish background color again because it not
only had poor contrast but also isn't really something like iTunes sidebar
but rather a Finder link list view. I hope you enjoy.
